synopsis: "A framework for verification of causal consistency for distributed key-value stores and their clients in Coq"
description: """
A framework for modular verification of causal consistency for replicated key-value
store implementations and their client programs in Coq. Includes proofs of the causal consistency
of two key-value store implementations and a simple automatic model checker for the correctness
of client programs.
