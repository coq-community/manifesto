This project contains Hoare Type Theory libraries which
demonstrate a series of design patterns for programming
with canonical structures that enable one to carefully
and predictably coax Coq's type inference engine into triggering
the execution of user-supplied algorithms during unification, and
illustrates these patterns through several realistic examples drawn
from Hoare Type Theory. The project also contains typeclass-based
re-implementations for comparison.


More details about the project can be found in the paper
[How to make ad hoc proof automation less ad hoc](https://software.imdea.org/~aleks/papers/lessadhoc/journal.pdf).

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Lemma Overloading
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-lemma-overloading
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/lemma-overloading
cd lemma-overloading
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
make install
```

After installation, the included modules are available under
the `LemmaOverloading` namespace.


## Files described in the paper

### `indom.v`

This file contains the indomR lemma from Section 3 "A simple overloaded lemma"

### `terms.v`, `xfind.v`, `cancel.v`, `cancelD.v`, `cancel2.v`

These files prove the `cancelR` lemma from Section 4 "Reflection: Turning
semantics into syntax". The first one contains the abstract syntax for heaps
along with the lemma `cancel_sound`. `xfind.v` has the xfind structure
to find an element in a list, return its index, and extend the list if the
element is not found. The file `cancel.v` has the main overloaded lemma `cancelR`.
Finally, `cancelD.v` contains the `simplify` lemma from section 4.3 and `cancel2.v`
contains an alternative version of the cancellation function without using
reflection.
 
### `stlogR.v`

File containing a whole bunch of overloaded lemmas to automate the verification
of imperative programs using Hoare Type Theory. The main technicalities in this
file are covered in Section 5 "Solving for functional instances".

### `noalias.v`

File containing all the automated lemmas described in Section 6 "Flexible
composition and application of overloaded lemmas".


## Bonus track

The files below didn't make it to the paper but deserve attention.

### `auto.v`

This file contains an adapted example from VeriML (Stampoulist and Shao),
to automatically prove propositions in a logic with binders.

### `llistR.v`

Verification of a linked list datatype using the "step" overloaded lemma described in Section 5.2.

### `noaliasBT.v`

There are several ways to attack a problem.
Some of them lead to interesting but yet not entirely satisfactory results.
Here are two versions of the `noalias` overloaded lemma with a different look.

### `indomCTC.v`, `xfindCTC.v`, `cancelCTC.v`, `noaliasCTC.v`, `stlogCTC.v` 

These files contains the same automated lemmas as in the files `indom`, `cancel`,
`noalias` and `stlogR`, but done with Coq Type Classes.
